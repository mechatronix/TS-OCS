The selected example is a non linear optimal control problem, yet simple, can be numerically difficult depending on the choosen values of the problem's parameters. Under some conditions, the problem also has the analytical solution that can be used to evaluate the solution methods accuracy.  \r\nThe problem has been formulated and solved according the following solution methods:\r\n\r\n * Differential Dynamic Programming using the code freely available at http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Downloads/DownloadFiles/dpm\r\n * Indirect method with finite difference approximation of the obtained BVP. The non linear system is solved using a number of numerical solvers written in Matlab code and PINS http://pins.github.io.\r\n * Direct Method: direct transcription (same finite difference approximation)  into a Non Linear Programming and solution using various optimiser: IPOPT, Matlab fmincon().\r\n\r\nIn the future this repository will be extended in order to become a test suite for optimal control software with code publicly available and a large set of benchmark tests (possibly with analytical solution for method's accuracy evaluation).\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nThe code can be downloaded and freely used as is. \r\n\r\n## How to cite\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contacts\r\n\r\nFrancesco Biral (francesco.biral@unitn.it)\r\n\r\nEnrico Bertolazzi (enrico.bertolazzi@unitn.it)\r\n\r\nPaolo Bosetti (paolo.bosetti@unitn.it)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
